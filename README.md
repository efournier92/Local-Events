#Local Events API Scraper

##Description

This was my first foray in interacting with an API to retrieve JSON data.

I used an API to dynamically find out what events are happening in the user's city during the next 24 hours.

The result is a simple Command Line Application. Simply run `app.rb` and input your city, and the app will output all events happening in Boston today.
